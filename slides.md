# what we did

:: content ::

We have been around 15 (sometimes 20) in the room, and another dozen online.

3 days of "hackathon" and presentations. Results: 
- we did not hack much at the end
- we certainly discussed
- we sorted specific issues
- in general, seems to me we did useful work

we will have more hacking (probably discussing) tomorrow

# From the DIRAC Consortium

:: content ::

DiracX "is here" but there are concerns about adoption:

```
The consortium Board recognizes concerns about the complexity of deployment and operations
of the DIRAC9/DiracX installations
and considers necessary to explore scenarios of a "minimal" installation
with limited external dependencies and Kubernetes-free way of running DIRAC services.
```

Elections of the Consortium Coordinator and Technical Coordinator for the next two-years term:
- A.Tsaregorodtsev reelected as the Consortium Coordinator
- F.Stagni reelected as the Consortium Technical Coordinator
